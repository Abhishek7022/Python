******************** Methods And Functions ********************

Both Methods and Functions are blocks of reusable code that can be used to perform various tasks.
This makes the code more organized and readable.


1. Functions:

A function is a block of reusable code that is used to perform a specific task.

Syntax:
def function_name():
   rest_of_the_code

Example:
def hello(name):
   print(f"Hello! {name}")

hello('Satomi')

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Methods:

A Method is similar to a function, but it is associated with objects. Methods are functions that
belong to a class and typically operate on the data contained within the class.

Methods are defined inside a class and called upon instances of that class.

Example:

class Greeter:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, {self.name}!"

# Creating an instance of the class
greeter = Greeter("Bob")

# Calling the method
print(greeter.greet())  # Output: Hello, Bob!
